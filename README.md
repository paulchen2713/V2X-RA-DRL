# **V2X-RA-DRL**
Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Cellular V2X Communications

## **Note**
- This is a recent upload of a project from 16 months ago. The code is somewhat poorly written, lacking in extensibility and likely not maintainable.
- It fails to pass some static analysis and has shown to have 2 potential bugs.
